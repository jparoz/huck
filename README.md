# Huck

A purely functional programming language,
bringing type-safety, purity, and functional idioms to the Lua ecosystem.

# Overview

This is a personal project of mine,
and is not currently ready for production use!

See [the associated Github Project](https://github.com/users/jparoz/projects/1)
for the roadmap of planned features;
and see the [`examples`](examples) directory
for some examples of Huck code.
